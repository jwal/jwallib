# Personal repository for James Ascroft-Leigh

This repository has some snippets of code that I have found useful in
the past.  As you can see from the commit history, my propensity to
commit code here isn't constant over time.

# Git Browser

Lately I have been experimenting with Apache CouchDB.  My experimental
application to explore this platform is a Git source code repository
browser.  Try it at
[http://jwallib.declarative.co.uk](http://jwallib.declarative.co.uk).
